Part 3.
- Implement Delaunay triangulation for 2D points
- Implement α-shapes to find the outline of the projection (check multiple α values)

Part 4.
- ear clipping for polygon triangulation
- Compute area of triangles
- Compare with monte carlo


Speed Improvements:
- project all points of the mesh to the plane
- use Delaunay and α-shape to find points on outline
- use ear clipping to triangulate the outline
- much fewer triangles left (from 11k)
