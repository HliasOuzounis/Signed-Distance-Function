# Todo

## Part A

### ~~Part 2~~

- [X] ~~Rotate plane before projection~~
- [X] ~~Change Kd-Tree to handle projections~~

### Part 3

- [ ] Implement Delaunay triangulation for 2D points
- [X] split projection and point cloud points. Retain points only if inside projection
- [X] Implement α-shapes to find the outline of the projection (check multiple α values)
- [X] Create outline_constructo

### ~~Part 4~~

- [X] Compute area of triangles
- [X] Compare with monte carlo

## Part B

### ~~Part 5~~

* [X]  Change intersection algorithm to count intersections. Assume ray coming out from point torwards +z. If > 0 and % 2 == 1, point is inside

### Part 6

* [ ] Create a dict/list: key: vertice id, values: list[triangle ids that contain vertice]
* [ ] Find k closest vertices. Smallest distance is to one of their triangles/one of the vertices\

### Part 7

* [X] Implement ray marching
