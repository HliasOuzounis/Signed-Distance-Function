## Part A

### ~~Part 2~~

- [X] ~~Rotate plane before projection~~
- [X] ~~Change Kd-Tree to handle projections~~

### Part 3

- [ ] Implement Delaunay triangulation for 2D points
- [X] split projection and point cloud points. Retain points only if inside projection
- [X] Implement α-shapes to find the outline of the projection (check multiple α values)
- [X] Create outline_constructo

### Part 4

- [ ] ear clipping for polygon triangulation
- [ ] Compute area of triangles
- [ ] Compare with monte carlo
